# Godot player controller
Simple player controller in godot, with custom and flexable jumping, walking and gravity. Also there is QoL feature for jumps, if you press jump few frames you land on ground, it will try to jump for few frames. This is my first controller.

In project you can see Translator.gd, this is kind of translate function from Unity.
